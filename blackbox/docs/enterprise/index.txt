Enterprise Features
===================

CrateDB provides an `Enterprise Edition`_, which is activated by default.
The source code remains open, but if you want to use one of the enterprise
features in production you need to purchase a `enterprise license`_.

Current features:

- :ref:`jmx_monitoring_plugin`: monitor your query stats with JMX
- :doc:`/administration/index`: manage your database with authentication, and
  more
- :ref:`Support for JavaScript in UDF <udf_lang_js>`: write user-defined
  functions in JavaScript
